How to create a simple CRUD Restful with Mysql Database

Prerequisites:

MySQL 5.5 or 5.6
IDE ( preffered Eclipse 4.3+)
JDK 1.7 
Maven 3.*
Hibernate 4
Spring 4
Tomcat 8


Install and run the project

download/clone the project
prepare the database
import in MySQL the self-contained file that comes with the project - demo-rest-jersey-spring / src / main / resources / input_data / DumpRESTdemoDB.sql
username/password - rest_demo/rest_demo

In case you want to test the application with some dummy data and without using any client application, you can do that using Chrome's Postman - REST Client. 
Make sure to set content-type: application/json when sending form data in JSON format to the service.
